# Transfer Analysis

This repository is being used as part of an ongoing project by the transfer learning sub-team of CAM2.
The current goal of our team is to provide an effective and time efficient tool that can be used to transfer knowledge across image domains, while avoiding negative transfer. Our primary focus will be images of people.

## Sub-Goals

1. Further characterize negative transfer as a problem with regards to transferring knowledge across image domains with people.
2. Anaylze the performance of state of the art methods in the domains of interest - people images.
3. Given a model trained on some source domain, as well as a target domain, determine which neurons negatively impact the models ability to move from source to target domain, reset these neurons, and retrain.
4.  Empirically establish a point in the model that at which to stop the algorithm mentioned in sub-goal 3.
