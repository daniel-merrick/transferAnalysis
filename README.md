# transferAnalysis

This repository is being used as part of an ongoing project by the transfer learning sub-team of CAM2.
The current goal of our team is to provide an effective and time efficient tool that can be used to transfer knowledge across image domains, while avoiding negative transfer. Our primary focus will be images of people taken from network cameras.

## Sub-Goals

1. Further characterize negative transfer as a problem with regards to transferring knowledge across image domains with people.
2. Anaylze the performance of state of the art methods   
3. Empirically establish a point in deep learning models where resetting the weights and biases no longer reduces the effects
